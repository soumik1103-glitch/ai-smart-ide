/**
 * Manages line heights in the editor with support for custom line heights from decorations.
 *
 * This class maintains an ordered collection of line heights, where each line can have either
 * the default height or a custom height specified by decorations. It supports efficient querying
 * of individual line heights as well as accumulated heights up to a specific line.
 *
 * Line heights are stored in a sorted array for efficient binary search operations. Each line
 * with custom height is represented by a {@link CustomLine} object which tracks its special height,
 * accumulated height prefix sum, and associated decoration ID.
 *
 * The class optimizes performance by:
 * - Using binary search to locate lines in the ordered array
 * - Batching updates through a pending changes mechanism
 * - Computing prefix sums for O(1) accumulated height lookup
 * - Tracking maximum height for lines with multiple decorations
 * - Efficiently handling document changes (line insertions and deletions)
 *
 * When lines are inserted or deleted, the manager updates line numbers and prefix sums
 * for all affected lines. It also handles special cases like decorations that span
 * the insertion/deletion points by re-applying those decorations appropriately.
 *
 * All query operations automatically commit pending changes to ensure consistent results.
 * Clients can modify line heights by adding or removing custom line height decorations,
 * which are tracked by their unique decoration IDs.
